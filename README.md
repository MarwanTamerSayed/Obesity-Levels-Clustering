# Obesity-Levels-Clustering
# 🧠 Obesity Clustering using Unsupervised Learning

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and cluster individuals based on obesity-related data. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, visualization, clustering using K-Means, and evaluation of cluster characteristics.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Identify clusters (groups) of individuals with similar obesity-related features without using labeled outcomes.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature encoding and scaling
  - K-Means clustering
  - Elbow method for optimal cluster selection
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
